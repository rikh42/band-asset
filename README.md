Asset Manager
=============

This was build as a simple asset management solution for PHP projects. It can
be used to merge and minify multiple css files into a single cached file. The
goal is to reduce the number of HTTP requests being made, and to automate the
process of combining and minify'ing the files involved.

It was created to integrate with the Band Framework (www.bandframework.com),
but it should be simple to integrate with other frameworks.

It also includes a Twig extension that provides a simple way of using the
component from within your twig templates.
